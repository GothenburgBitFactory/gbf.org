# Holidata

Holidata is a utility for algorithmically producing holiday dates for a given locale and year.

* Current release: {{< current_release holidata >}}
* Repository: [https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata)

## About

Its main purpose is to calculate the holiday files provided on [holidata.net](https://holidata.net).

Holidata provides holiday data in different locales, i.e. for a given country and in a given language.
See [holidata.net](https://holidata.net) for a complete overview of the currently provided locales.

Holidata focuses on holidays which are defined by law on which business or work are suspended or reduced (there may be some exceptions to that rule).

Holidata only provides data for countries and their principal subdivisions (both as they are defined in ISO 3166).
Holidays for other subdivisions are either merged or ignored.
There is also no explicit representation of partial holidays.
