# VIT

VIT (Visual Interactive Taskwarrior) is a lightweight, curses-based front end for Taskwarrior that provides a convenient way to quickly navigate and process tasks.

* `git clone https://github.com/scottkosty/vit.git`
* `brew install vit`

## About

VIT allows you to interact with tasks in a Vi-intuitive way.

A goal of VIT is to allow you to customize the way in which you use Taskwarrior's core commands as well as to provide a framework for easily dispatching external commands (both user scripts and Taskwarrior's many [External Scripts](https://taskwarrior.org/tools)).
