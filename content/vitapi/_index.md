# Vitapi

Vitapi (it started as an acronym) is a lightweight, easy to use, and above all, simple alternative to ncurses, without the legacy support, and without complex features.
It targets mostly modern xterm capabilities, supports 256 colors, the mouse, and a nice powerful color model.
It provides a C API, for maximum utility.
